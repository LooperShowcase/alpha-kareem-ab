      Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس غالي,
      Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli]; born 15 June
      1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for
      Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team.
      Considered one of the best players in the world and amongst the greatest
      African players of all time, he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and
      speed.[8][9] Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al
      Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super
      League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11
      million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and
      Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016–17
      season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's title race against ultimate
      league winners Juventus, reaching double figures in both goals and
      assists.[10]
